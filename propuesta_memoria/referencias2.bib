La infraestructura necesaria para llevar a cabo este objetivo requiere una inversi{\'{o}}n financiera significativa; por lo tanto, proveer el dise{\~{n}}o {\'{o}}ptimo de estas redes es muy importante. No solo el aspecto econ{\'{o}}mico es primordial; adem{\'{a}}s de {\'{e}}l, hay otros como el comportamiento hidr{\'{a}}ulico, que se refiere a las presiones y velocidades m{\'{a}}ximas, la disponibilidad de tuber{\'{i}}as, la calidad del agua, la distribuci{\'{o}}n de la demanda, la fiabilidad de la red, el funciona-miento del sistema, los que complican a{\'{u}}n m{\'{a}}s un an{\'{a}}lisis integral conducente a un dise{\~{n}}o {\'{o}}ptimo. La optimizaci{\'{o}}n de una red de agua, por su complejidad, est{\'{a}} asociada al problema combinatorio llamado NP-Duro, lo que significa que no es posible utilizar un m{\'{e}}todo determin{\'{i}}stico para resolverlo, sino que requiere de metodolog{\'{i}}as especiales que haciendo uso de un tiempo compu-tacional razonable permita obtener una configuraci{\'{o}}n de di{\'{a}}metros que cumpla con las limitaciones (velocidad y presi{\'{o}}n), as{\'{i}} como en alcanzar valores aceptables en los objetivos que se buscan (menor costo y mayor confiabilidad). El uso de algoritmos gen{\'{e}}ticos multiobjetivos permite solucionar este tipo de problemas combinatorios NP-Duro; consecuentemente, optimiza una red de agua. Para encontrar un conjunto {\'{o}}ptimo de soluciones, se desarroll{\'{o}} un programa de ordenador llamado Magmoredes, que se basa en el uso de un microalgoritmo gen{\'{e}}tico multiobjetivo, pro-puesto por Coello y Toscano [1], adaptado para la aplicaci{\'{o}}n de redes de distribuci{\'{o}}n de agua, que fue desarrollado para cumplir con las exigencias econ{\'{o}}micas, y bajo los l{\'{i}}mites de presi{\'{o}}n y velocidad seg{\'{u}}n la normativa peruana. El programa de ordenador se ha desarrollado en el lenguaje de programaci{\'{o}}n Java. Finalmente se procedi{\'{o}} a comprobar la eficacia del algoritmo propuesto en la red de Hanoi (Fujiwara y Khang, [2]). Se trata de una red que tiene una sola fuente, con tres circuitos b{\'{a}}sicos, treinta y uno nodos, un reservorio y treinta y cuatro tuber{\'{i}}as. Los nodos se encuentran en la misma elevaci{\'{o}}n y no se consideran las p{\'{e}}rdidas menores en las tuber{\'{i}}as.},

	abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use$\backslash$nnon-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1)$\backslash$ntheir O(MN{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) computational complexity (where M is the number$\backslash$nof objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism$\backslash$napproach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this$\backslash$npaper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II$\backslash$n(Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of$\backslash$nthe above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting$\backslash$napproach with O(MN{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) computational complexity is presented.$\backslash$nAlso, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by$\backslash$ncombining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N$\backslash$nsolutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on$\backslash$ndifficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to$\backslash$nfind a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the$\backslash$ntrue Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution$\backslash$nstrategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other$\backslash$nelitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse$\backslash$nPareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in$\backslash$norder to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently.$\backslash$nSimulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test$\backslash$nproblems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear$\backslash$nproblem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective$\backslash$noptimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

@article{Leung1990,
	abstract = {The authors identify the common errors and faults in combining modules into a working unit. They also make practical recommendations on test selection for integration testing and utilize these recommendations for regression testing at the integration level. With emphasis on reusing the previous test cases and retesting only the parts that are modified, one can reduce the testing expenses. The concept of 'firewall' is proposed to assist the tester in focusing on that part of the system where new errors may have been introduced by a correction or a design change. An experiment is presented in which an application of strategy is compared with the 'retest-all' strategy. By applying the approach for test selection, it is possible to discover all errors found by the retest-all strategy by executing only 35{\%} of the total number of test cases.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to present a body of evidence that will assist software project managers to make informed choices about software development approaches for their projects. In particular, two broadly defined competing approaches, the traditional "waterfall" approach and iterative and incremental development (IID), are compared with regards to development cost and duration, and resulting product quality. The method used for this comparison is a systematic literature review. The small set of studies we located did not demonstrate any identifiable cost, duration, or quality trends, although there was some evidence suggesting the superiority of IID (in particular XP). The results of this review indicate that further empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, on this topic need to be undertaken. In order to effectively compare study results, the research community needs to reach a consensus on a set of comparable parameters that best assess cost, duration, and quality. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

@article{Romanycia1985,
	abstract = {From the mid-1950's to the present the notion of a heuristic has played a crucial role in the AI researchers' descriptions of their work. What has not been generally noticed is that different researchers have often applied the term to rather different aspects of their programs. Things that would be called a heuristic by one researcher would not be so called by others. This is because many heuristics embody a variety of different features, and the various researchers have emphasized different ones of these features as being essential to being a heuristic. This paper steps back from any particular research program and investigates the question of what things, historically, have been thought to be central to the notion of a heuristic and which ones conflict with others. After analyzing the previous definitions and examining current usage of the term, a synthesizing definition is provided. The hope is that with this broader account of ‘heuristic' in hand, researchers can benefit more fully from the insights of others, even if those insights are couched in a somewhat alien vocabulary.},
